THE LITTLE DOG-ANGEL<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
High up in the courts of Heaven to-day<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A little dog-angel waits,</SPAN><BR>
With the other angels he will not play,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">But he sits alone at the gates;</SPAN><BR>
"For I know that my master will come," says he:<BR>
"And when he comes, he will call for me."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He sees the spirits that pass him by<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">As they hasten towards the throne,</SPAN><BR>
And he watches them with a wistful eye<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">As he sits at the gates alone;</SPAN><BR>
"But I know if I just wait patiently<BR>
That some day my master will come," says he.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And his master, far on the earth below,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">As he sits in his easy chair,</SPAN><BR>
Forgets sometimes, and he whistles low<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">For the dog that is not there;</SPAN><BR>
And the little dog-angel cocks his ears,<BR>
And dreams that his master's call he hears.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I know, when at length his master waits<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Outside in the dark and cold</SPAN><BR>
For the hand of Death to ope the gates<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">That lead to those courts of gold,</SPAN><BR>
The little dog-angel's eager bark<BR>
Will comfort his soul in the shivering dark.<BR>

A SONG OF ERIN<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Far to westward in the sunset tall and bare her cliffs arise,<BR>
Mother Erin, with the tender love and laughter in her eyes,<BR>
Looking out across the waters, dreaming of her argosies.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Argosies that sail forever, laden down with hopes and fears,<BR>
Ships of dream, returning never, though she waits throughout the years,<BR>
Waits, with eyes wherein the laughter grows more sorrowful than tears.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
One by one her children leave her&mdash;stalwart sons and daughters fair,<BR>
Straining eyes grown dim with anguish as her hilltops melt in air;<BR>
Bending from her cliffs she watches, drinking deep of their despair.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yet she showers her gifts upon them&mdash;gifts of laughter and of tears;<BR>
Gives their eyes the Vision Splendid, fairy music to their ears,<BR>
Weaves around their feet her magic&mdash;spells that strengthen through<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2em">the years,</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So her children, unforgetting, howsoe'er their footsteps roam,<BR>
Turn their hearts forever westward, longing for the day to come<BR>
When once more they see her stooping from her heights to call them home.<BR>

As I went down to Dublin town<BR>

She looked at me, she laughed at me<BR>

No mortal maid was half so fair,<BR>

So witching were the eyes of her<BR>

Into the depths of the dark, green wood<BR>

Golden-armoured and golden-curled,<BR>
Faith, the sweetest song in the world<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">His heart was hearing!</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Onward he rode, with heart elate;<BR>

Jewelled fingers and golden crown,<BR>
Slim young body and eyes as brown<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
On he rode through a laughing land:<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The ways grew wider,</SPAN><BR>
There stood a cottage close at hand,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And there he spied her&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
O but her feet were brown and bare,<BR>
And brown were her curls, as she stood there<BR>

Alas! for the Princess, proud and slim,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The great King's daughter;</SPAN><BR>
We'll trust she wasted no thought on him,<BR>

Forgot her jewels and golden crown,<BR>
For the goose-girl's laughing eyes were brown<BR>

Then straightway down from his steed he sprang<BR>

But what the words he said in her ear,<BR>
Since none but her geese were by to hear,<BR>

No incense burns at her altar&mdash;at her shrine no lamplight gleams,<BR>
But she guards the Fountains of Quiet, and she keeps the key of Dreams,<BR>
And I will sit in the shadows and pray her, of her grace,<BR>
To open her guarded visions and grant me to dream of your face.<BR>

Her balms of healing and silence and of dreams upon my head.<BR>

The sunny streets of Oxford<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Are lying still and bare,</SPAN><BR>
No sound of voice or laughter<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Rings through the golden air;</SPAN><BR>
And, chiming from her belfry,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No longer Christchurch calls</SPAN><BR>
The eager, boyish faces<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">To gather in her halls.</SPAN><BR>

The colleges are empty,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Only the sun and wind</SPAN><BR>

But, when the trooping shadows<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Have put the day to flight,</SPAN><BR>
The Gentlemen of Oxford<BR>

They linger in her cloisters,<BR>

Till Isis hears their calling<BR>
